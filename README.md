Goal:
To help people see that given they have a certain health problem what is the likelihood of having other health problems that are co-morbid. Using this they can double check with their doctor if they have checked for those other diseases.

Another application is determining if doctors are within the range of national percent of people having these co-morbid diseases. To make sure the doctors are being thorough with their process.
