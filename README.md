# Co-Morbidity

capstone project

## Goal:

To help people see that given they have a certain health problem what is the likelihood of having other health problems that are co-morbid in the psychiatry field. Using this they can double check with their doctor if they have checked for those other disorders. The reason I wanted to do psychiatry is because these diagnosis are especially related to a doctors discretion.  

Another application is determining if doctors are within the range of national percent of people having these co-morbid diseases. To make sure the doctors are being thorough with their process.

## Data:

    * The information I am using has 19,830 individuals in 6 months of data with 11 different doctors that go to several hospitals. There are 154 different symptoms and disorders that I have to compare.

    * I chose to separate by gender and age by groups of 20. I chose groups of 20 years so make sure it still has a good number of patients for each group. And in the bar graphs I discard any co-morbid diagnosis that have 1 or less patients with it.

## Visualization:

    * I would like to make a web app to be able to find the information based on personal information entered. And currently using bar graphs to visualize but would like to use different visualization tools.
